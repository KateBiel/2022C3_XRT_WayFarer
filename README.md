#  🎒 WayFarer360 🚶

WayFarer360 is an educational prototype created by a four-member team during the XR Developer Bootcamp at XR Terra. Initially designed for PC, it shares engaging narratives from three iconic NYC 🗽 locations: the World Trade Center, the Flatiron, and Federal Hall. After touring, users can take a quiz on their new knowledge.

As part of our continuous improvement process, we've elevated the user experience by transitioning the project to Virtual Reality 🥽 (WayFarer VR), offering a more dynamic and immersive audience engagement.
