#  🎒 WayFarer360 🚶

WayFarer360 is an educational prototype created by a four-member team during the XR Developer Bootcamp at XR Terra. Initially designed for PC, it shares engaging narratives from three iconic NYC 🗽 locations: the World Trade Center, the Flatiron, and Federal Hall. After touring, users can take a quiz on their new knowledge.

As part of our continuous improvement process, we've elevated the user experience by transitioning the project to Virtual Reality 🥽 (WayFarer VR), offering a more dynamic and immersive audience engagement.

🔴 YouTube Demo: [WayFarerVR Main Menu](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/NnH_QHluVlc)

Design easier-to-use interface, with a clear menu for Travel and Learn experiences.
Separating the modes allows for a more streamlined and focused user experience within each mode. Users can immerse themselves fully in either the travel or learning aspect without distractions or interruptions from the other mode.

🔴 YouTube Demo: [WayFarerVR Quiz Logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m84a_ciq5zs&ab_channel=KattBiel)

Develop better quiz logic for the WayFarer prototype. As an experiment, managing local registry within Unity using PlayerPrefs. Though the concept is relatively straightforward, it adequately fulfills all the project's current requirements
